# Customer-Behavior-Analysis
- In this project, I use exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights that address business questions aimed at improving customer retention and satisfaction for the online retail store. EDA is employed to provide valuable insights that can drive business growth and enhance the customer experience.

**About Project**

- The online retail industry is highly competitive, and customer retention is crucial for long-term success. To enhance customer retention and satisfaction, an online retail store decided to perform customer behavior analysis. The online retail store collected data on various parameters such as InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, and Country.

- The data collected was analyzed using various techniques such as data visualization and statistical analysis. The online retail store identified patterns in customer behavior such as buying frequency, product preferences, and the time of purchase. They also analyzed the factors that influenced customer behavior, such as product quality, sales volumn, and seasonal trends.
